### Abstract
We tackle the thief orienteering problem (ThOP), an academic multi-component
problem that combines two classical combinatorial problems, namely the Knapsack
Problem and the Orienteering Problem. In the ThOP, a thief has a time limit to steal
items that distributed in a given set of cities. While traveling, the thief collects items
by storing them in their knapsack, which in turn reduces the travel speed. The thief
has as the objective to maximize the total profit of the stolen items. In this article,
we present an approach that combines swarm-intelligence with a randomized packing
heuristic. Our solution approach outperforms existing works on almost all the 432
benchmarking instances, with significant improvements

### Essential Concepts 
This is the main paper used for Operations Research - solving the Thief Orienteering Problem (ThOP) with MMACO. It is a must-read to gain a comprehensive understanding of the problem you are solving, with relevant references.
